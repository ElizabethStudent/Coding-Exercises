# Coding Exercises

Welcome to the Coding Exercises directory. Here you will find samples of code that do useful or interesting things that make data handling easier and quicker. Feel free to add your own examples.

### Here are the rules:
1. Include your own made up sample data that does not require a imported dataset.
2. List all required libraries at the beginning of the file.
3. Use comments for each line of code.
